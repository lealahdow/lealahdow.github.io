		<h1>About Me</h1>

		<p>I am an Australian Graphic Designer, living in Amsterdam. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because after many years of designing websites and procrastinating, I have admitted it is time to learn how to code. This course seemed like a great accessible first step. I want to be able to create personal projects for causes I am passionate about and help out friends without relying on developers to complete what I know are simple tasks. The added bonus is that it will make me more employable!</p>

		<h2>My Mission</h2>

		<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to continue my design career and build on my existing skills to become both more independent in my freelance work and useful in my collaborations. Because I like to work with organisations who want to make a difference and I see this as the most effective way to contribute.</p>
