		<h1>Unit two design challenge</h1>

		<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
		<p><a href="https://canopy.co/">canopy.co<a></p>
		<p><a href="http://quay.com.au/">quay.com.au<a></p>

		<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
		<h3>Canopy:</h3>
		<p>This site uses a nice amount of negative space. Both the single colour backgrounds and white space around the products gives it a clean contemporary feel. Having ample space between borders and edges makes the content easy to read and navigate.</p>
		<p>The size of the images is large and the text content is minimal. This makes the products the clear focal point and stops the user from being distracted.</p>
		<p>The grid layout keeps the site balanced. The use of two, three and four column squares creates a sense of hierarchy and allows more content to be viewed at one time without creating of clutter. I like the way the trending products are displayed with an odd column width and reversed type. This example of changing balance helps them stand out while keeping inline with the site design.
		</p>

		<h3>Quay:</h3>
		<p>Again this website uses a large amount of negative space. This gives the small snippets of copy plenty of space helping them to stand out more. The spacing and sizing of headings, paragraphs and buttons also means each section of content fills the screen nicely creating a smooth and interesting flow.</p>
		<p>The large images also add to the flow of the home page. The size of the panels behind the text separates the information into digestible chunks. Almost like paper flyers. The large buttons are clear and clickable to help guide the user through the site.</p>
		<p>The simplicity of this website means that the design could be playful with the offsetting of images and text. Keeping the panels aligned on the left and right edges of the page keeps the site feeling tidy creates balance. Large headings with small body copy create a clear hierarchy.</p>

		<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
		<h3>What is similar:</h3>
		<p>These two sites are similar in the overall clean and simple feel. The designs use plenty of negative space and simple typography. They both use a subtle cool grey, one strong contrasting feature colour and white behind the copy to define columns and help the text stand out. They both use large images. I like the use of subtle animation on both. It makes the sites feel clever and interactive. I think it helps with the flow.</p>

		<h3>What is different:</h3>
		<p>The Canopy site layout is lot more traditionally structured than Quay. They use mostly symmetrical shapes and have the text centre aligned using only one font. The Quay site uses two fonts as well as capital and bold features. Quay uses parallax and much larger images.</p>

		<h2>Thumbnail sketches</h2>
		<ul>
        <li><strong>Home Page</strong><br><img src="assets/ThumbnailImages/home.jpg" width="200" height="267" alt="Lealah Dow's home page thumbnail sketch">
        <p>Sketch one uses a large scale image behind a short intro paragraph as the focal point. There is a call to action button which invites users to view the portfolio. The paragraphs below are smaller which creates a hierarchy. The read more links provide alternate paths.</p>

        <p>Sketch two also uses balance to create a focal point. The use of different size squares creates hierarchy while the grid keeps the balance. The user is invited to explore the various boxes of content. The site would use animation to enhance that feeling of exploration</p>

       	</li>
       	<li><strong>About Page</strong><br><img src="assets/ThumbnailImages/about.jpg" width="200" height="267" alt="Lealah Dow's home page thumbnail sketch">
        <p>In sketch one the layout is very simple. The large image intro section followed by the smaller profiles below as well as font size creates a very clear hierarchy.</p>
        <p>The layout in page two puts more emphasis on the body copy of the page. The use of a smaller column on the top left creates a flow from left to right and top to bottom.</p>
       	</li>

		</li>
       	<li><strong>Portfolio Page</strong><br><img src="assets/ThumbnailImages/portfolio.jpg" width="200" height="267" alt="Lealah Dow's home page thumbnail sketch">
        <p>Sketch one uses hero images in a carousel to promote the featured projects which establishes a hierarchy. The click through buttons provide a clear paths for users to take</p>
        <p>Sketch two uses a more exploratory approach. The titles above each column sort the content below. The many small squares mean that more content can be displayed at once while the symmetrical layout creates a sense of balance.</p>
       	</li>

       	</li>
       	<li><strong>Contact Page</strong><br><img src="assets/ThumbnailImages/contact.jpg" width="200" height="267" alt="Lealah Dow's home page thumbnail sketch">
        <p>Sketch one follows on from the others in using large scale background space to bring the content forward. The simple layout and use of negative space creates balance and readability</p>
        <p>Sketch two again follows on from the other sketch two pages. The page title is clear and the flow goes from left to right and down the page.</p>
       	</li>
